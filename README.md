# 🧠 Research Copilot

**Research Copilot** is an **agentic literature analysis system** that automates the journey from raw research papers to structured insights, synthesis, and critique using Large Language Models (LLMs).

It is built to help researchers, students, and engineers **rapidly understand a research area**, identify trends, gaps, and evaluate the quality of synthesized conclusions.

---

## ✨ What This Project Does

Given a research topic, Research Copilot:

1. 🔍 Searches arXiv for relevant papers  
2. 📄 Downloads and parses PDFs  
3. 🧠 Extracts structured metadata using an LLM agent  
4. 🧩 Synthesizes insights across papers  
5. 🧪 Critiques the synthesis using a Critic Agent  
6. 🖥️ Visualizes everything in a Streamlit UI  

All stages are **modular, inspectable, and agent-driven**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Topic
│
▼
[ arXiv Ingestion ]
│
▼
[ PDF Parsing ]
│
▼
[ Extraction Agent ]
│   → task, method, datasets, metrics, results, limitations
▼
[ Synthesis Agent ]
│   → trends, dominant tasks, gaps, open questions
▼
[ Critic Agent ]
→ strengths, weaknesses, rating, suggested repairs

Each agent runs independently and writes outputs to **disk** and **SQLite**.

## 🤖 Agents

### 🔍 Extraction Agent
Reads parsed paper sections and produces structured JSON:
- task
- method
- datasets
- metrics
- key results
- limitations

### 🧠 Synthesis Agent
Aggregates extractions to identify:
- dominant research directions
- common metrics and datasets
- gaps and open problems

### 🧪 Critic Agent
Evaluates synthesis quality and outputs:
- overall rating (out of 10)
- strengths & weaknesses
- suggested repairs
- improved synthesis draft

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit UI

The Streamlit app provides:

- 🚀 One-click pipeline execution
- 📄 Browse extracted papers
- 🧠 View synthesis outputs
- 🧪 Inspect critic feedback
- 📜 Live pipeline logs

Run it with:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app/ui/streamlit_app.py

🔐 Configuration

Environment variables are required.
Never commit .env files.

Create one locally:

cp .env.example .env

Example:

LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
CRITIC_PROVIDER=gemini

DB_PATH=research.db

🧪 Run Full Pipeline (CLI)

python -m app.pipelines.run_full_pipeline

The Streamlit UI internally calls the same pipeline.

⸻

🧠 Is This RAG?

No — intentionally.

This is an agentic analysis pipeline, not a retrieval-augmented QA system.

RAG can be added later in parallel (e.g., “Ask questions over extracted sections”), but the core value here is structured reasoning across papers, not just answering queries.

⸻

🚧 Known Limitations (v1)
	•	arXiv API rate limiting
	•	Occasional LLM JSON formatting errors
	•	No embedding / RAG layer yet

These are design-acknowledged, not architectural blockers.

⸻

🚀 Future Work
	•	Parallel RAG pipeline
	•	Embeddings over extracted sections
	•	Topic clustering & comparison
	•	Report export (Markdown / LaTeX)
	•	Cloud deployment

🎯 Why This Project Matters

Most tools say:

“Here are some papers.”

Research Copilot says:

“Here’s what this field is doing, how it’s evaluated, where it’s weak — and how good this synthesis actually is.”

This is research sensemaking, not search.
